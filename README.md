# Udacity's Front End Web Dev Weather Journal App project

I have created a weather web app that will use POST/GET routes to store and retrieve data from a node.js server that will dynamically update the web app UI with local weather info.

### Set up:
- Download files.
- Use your command terminal to navigate the project directory.
- You must hove node.js installed.
- In the terminal install express using `NPM install express`.
- In the terminal install cors using `NPM install cors`.
- In the terminal install body-parser using `NPM install body-parser`.
- Start the server with the code `node server.js`.
- You should get the following response in your terminal: `running on - localhost: 8000 once the server is running`.
- Open up your web browser and use the address bar navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

### Use:
- In the text box under "Zipcode" type in your local zip.
- In the text box under "How are we feeling today?" type in your feelings/ mood.
- Click generate. This will update the UI with a post with your location, time, temperature and your feelings.
